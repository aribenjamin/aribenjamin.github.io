It is impossible to deny that we carry emotions in our body[^1]. Stressed at work? You'll feel it in your back. Proud and joyful? Nervous? I'll let you finish those ones. 

You can also affect your emotional state by addressing the body. The arrow of causality runs in both directions: mind -> musculature and musculature -> mind. Think back to the last time you took a hot bath. On entering the water your muscles relaxed, and also _you_ relaxed. This bidirectionality of emotion, mind, and body is no new news. Around the world there are dozens of healing traditions premised on the idea that our bodies affect our emotions. Today, you can find it in titles like _The Body Keeps the Score_ and in theraputic practices under the umbrella of "somatic" practices. 

This aspect of our emotions – that they are affected by our bodily perception – is well-recognized in emotional psychology, where it forms the basis of the theory of _constructed emotion_. Emotions are not the same across all cultures – even the "basic ones" like anger and sadness. For just about every emotion that is felt as a "universal emotion" in the US, there is at least one culture for which that is not a basic emotional category. To make sense of this, theories of _constructed emotion_ say that emotions are perceptions of our bodies's visceral reactions[^2]. This means that they are influenced by the all the same category biases, cultural relativism, and linguistic associations as the rest of our perceptual decisions. For Lisa Feldman Barrett, among others, emotions are conceptual categorizations of that visceral stimulus. Emotional categories are perceptual concepts. If this idea is novel to you, I highly recommend this phenomenal podcast episodes about this idea by the great Invisibilia[^3].

Yet there's one thing I've never understood about the emotions-as-perceptual-concepts idea. Why is that information in the body in the first place? Why would our nervous systems endow our musculature with emotional information, only to then read-out emotions from that same musculature?

I find this fascinating, and mysterious. For the purposes of moving about in the world and changing things – affecting things – one's anxious muscle tension is useless. If you open a textbook on the neural control of movement, you will read that the point of our motor neurons firing is to move our bodies. (Indeed, the name of the field is "motor control" rather than "muscle control".) That our brains should be instructing our muscles to hold useless muscle tension simply falls outside of the paradigm of motor control.

What's even more puzzling is that muscles are expensive, metabolically speaking. It must take incredible energy to walk around all day tensing muscles more than is needed for movement. Elsewhere in biology it's bizarre to observe such a waste of energy. In fact, the idea of efficiency is usually a powerful explanatory tool. For example, there's a lot of study about what sorts of systems would emerge if we evolved to act and perceive while using a minimum amount of energy, and it turns out to be pretty close to biology in a lot of ways. This idea crops up everywhere from efficient coding in perception [^4] to movement control. One can get so much mileage out of efficiency, explain so many phenomena, that in certain fields of neuroscience it's a keystone concept. And yet, here we are, holding emotion in our bodies all day long throughout our entire lives.

Now, it's certainly possible that holding emotion in the body serves no purpose. The wasted energy is just a suboptimality of sorts. A bad accident, an evolutionary bystander for intelligence: maybe we didn't evolve to be so anxious. Or maybe you're just, you know, bad at being a human. I don't buy this at all. We're talking about subconscious motor control and emotion – evolutionary dinosaurs. (Of course we evolved to be anxious, silly.) These systems have had a while to evolve to be less extravagantly wasteful of ATP. No, this dismissal smells to me like the refusal to admit or consider facts that can't be explained. If it doesn't make sense, simply call it noise or suboptimal and move on.

Isn't it more likely that it does serve an adaptive purpose? That we are better for being this way? Let's at least entertain this possibility. If it serves a purpose, it is a solution to some problem. **What problem is embodied emotion a solution to?**

In this post I want to speculate a reason. The role that the physical body can play with unnecessary muscle tension is storing information about one's state and situation.

Emotions are modulators of our decisions and actions. If one were to write a computational description of emotion [^5], emotions would be state variables that shift our behavior and responses to the world. Anger, jealousy, sadness, excitement: one acts differently in each of these states. Emotions allow organisms to respond differently to same stimuli depending on its recent history and goals.

These state modulators need to be stored in the body for a considerable period of time: hours, or days. Perhaps – just maybe – the body and muscles provide an efficient and easy mechanism for the storage of information over these time periods. 

If this is true, the embodiment of one's emotional state is simply storage. Your body is a bank for information. More radically, your body's state _is_ that emotional state. This explains why our emotions are present in our bodies, and why our emotions act like perceptions of our bodies. 

To bolster my idea that this is actually useful, I should describe why the other mechanisms of a body tracking its state are not sufficient. It's typically understood that states are tracked through **neuromodulators** and **persistent neural activity**.

First, neuromodulators. These things are great. You've got cortisol for stress & exercise & lots of other things, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, bombesin, dynorphin, etc. The problem is that a neuromodulatory system is rather complex and low-level. Between receptors and signaling cascades, a new neuromodulator system requires dozens of proteins to work. It's possible that this means it's evolutionarily pretty difficult to evolve a new neuromodulator. This may explain why the majority of confirmed neuromodulators are for ancient needs: thirst, hunger, mating, dominance, pain, maternal instinct. 

As our social lives got more complicated in recent evolutionary history, our emotional lives needed to keep up in complexity. Since neuromodulatory systems take a while to develop, animals may have developed alternative systems of keeping track of state information and using it for behavior changes. Systems that repurposed the hardware we already have.

Now, why can't the brain just store state as, well, the activity of neurons? The answer there is that neural networks are really bad at storing information in persistent activity over long timescales. It'll fade within minutes. It's true that short-term plasticity could play this role, but this also fades quickly. What's left is needing plasticity mechanisms that persist for hours which encode an animal's recent state. This is certainly quite possible. But why not just use the body?

In summary, I'm proposing that the body is an information storage bank for particular behavioral states. When an animal decides to enter a new state, that information is held in persistent loops of muscle tension. One's state is read out from one's musculature, or changed by affecting one's musculature. 

It wouldn't be the first time in which we've observed animals using their bodies for computational purposes beyond direct movement. When training rats to press buttons with difficult time intervals, they tend to invent meandering movements that involve hitting the buttons at the right time[^6]. They "use their bodies as clocks".  

Broadly, this fits comfortably within the embodied cognition viewpoint. Our bodies serve a purpose beyond affecting the physical world. They assist our computations, as well. They are part and parcel of our cognitive machinery. Here, I'm proposing they form the machinery of a memory bank.

Now, this is starting to feel a little "out there." But I don't think I'm saying much that's new here. It's pretty uncontroversial that your body is in the loop of your emotions. (Go get a massage, if you don't believe me.) All I've added is a normative interpretation: a computational reason why this is useful. 

Here's an interesting experiment that could add weight to this perspective. Using widespread EMG, observe what patterns of muscle activations correspond to an expected emotional state (in the case of animals) or a reported emotion (in the case of humans). (Both have drawbacks: you don't know what animals are feeling; humans aren't very good at telling you either.) Then, do the same in a different context and emotion. You should observe different patterns. Next, *stimulate* muscle activation in one of the two patterns. You should observe a difference in evoked behavior, consistent with an emotion, (in the case of an animal), or the human subject will report feeling that emotion. The use of two observed emotions serves as a control that the stimulation itself doesn't cause the emotion. I think this experiment would be good evidence for constructed emotion. But, of course, it doesn't say _why_ this happens. It doesn't provide evidence for evolutionary pressure. I'm not sure of an experiment that would provide that further evidence.

I have reservations about the physicalist perspective inherent in this blog post, and in the idea that emotions are best understood as algorithms. It seems to flatten so much of the inherently human. But for the purposes of providing an evolutionary, normative argument, neuroscience has gotten far by treating our inner world as informaton processing. I'm certainly not going to be able to provide a workable alternative in this blog post.
